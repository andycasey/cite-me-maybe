Cite me maybe?
==============

Idea: Given some article, look at all of the references in that article. From all of those referenced articles, see who *else* referenced those articles.

Then we can see which articles were referenced in your "field" that your paper has not cited. Then we take the most N papers (by frequency as a popularity metric)
and recommend them.
